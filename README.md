# IoT-FireGUI

Extension for the IoT CSI Nexmon module that allows for a gui yo see live information from the local network, without requiring physical access to the main Raspberry Pi node.

When a rapid tempurature rise is detected, a warning will be detected on the GUI, and signals will be sent to a light, and sending an email to an email of the alert.
